# pyla

Manipulate with Python some photos of Lila from cameras installed in the Botanical Garden of Nancy to extract some stats. Finalized by a small internship at UMR "Forest Ecology and Ecophysiology" (University of Lorraine).

This is an old project. I only clean the main script. I will add data visualisation as soon as it's clean.

I only put 5 photos because the orignal project contains 8000 photos (1920x1080).
I put the results for year 2015.

pyla.py contain the logic
pyla_ctrl.py is an "How to do it"
